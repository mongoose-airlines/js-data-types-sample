# Dynamic vs. Static Typed Languages

Dynamically-typed languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby allow variables to be assigned different types of data during runtime (as the program executes). 

For example, in JavaScript we can do this:

```jsx
// Declare variable named data and initialize with a number
let data = 123
// Reassigning a different type of data is allowed
data = 'Hello'
```

However, statically-typed languages such as Java and C++ required a variable's type to be declared and cannot be changed:

```cpp
// Declare a variable as an integer and initialize
int data = 123
// Assigning anything other than an integer raises an error
data = "Hello" // NOT ALLOWED
```

<aside>
üß† There is a newer language called TypeScript you might hear about - this language is a superset of JS and adds strong typing to JS. Many developers agree that strong typing makes code less error-prone and is worth the extra effort to code in.

# Exploring JavaScript's Data Types

JavaScript has seven main data types:

- Six primitive data types which represent a **single** value
- and an Object (reference) type that can contain any number of primitive values and/or other objects.

Note that an object can be one of JavaScript's [**built-in object sub-types**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) such as:

- Array
- Function (yes, functions are objects in JavaScript!)
- RegExp
- Date
- Error
- BigInt

## Primitives

- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Number
- String
- Symbol

## Object

- Array

- Function
- RegEx
- Date

# Primitive Data Types

## string

A **string** represents textual data with zero or more characters wrapped by single or double quotation marks such as `"John"` or `'Jane'`. A pair of quotes with nothing between them is still a **string** - an *empty string*.

```jsx
let myString = 'Hello World'
let myOtherString = "Hello World"
console.log(typeof myString)
```

Note that the `typeof` operator itself always returns a string describing the data type.

<aside>
üß† **ES2015 Note**: In addition to using single and double quotes to delimit a string, ES2015 adds a third way by using the back-tick character to create what's called a template literal.  We'll learn more about template literals later in the course.

## number

A **number** represents a numeric value.

Unlike many other programming languages, there is no distinction between integer (`15`, `3`, etc.) and floating-point/decimal types (`17.24`, `3.1416`, etc.).

Internally, JS represents all numbers as floating-point values.

```jsx
let myNumber = 15
console.log(typeof myNumber)
```

‚ùìWhat will the following code print to the console?

```jsx
console.log(typeof 12.34)
```

## boolean

Whereas strings and numbers can have a virtually unlimited number of different values, the **boolean** data type only has two possible values: `true` and `false`.

## You Do üí™: Data Type Examples

**Strings**, **numbers**, and **booleans** are the most common data types used to "model" real-world data in applications.

For example, in a multiplayer gaming app, we would represent a player's Gamertag using a **string**.

Before moving on to review the other data types, let's brainstorm a couple of examples for each of the three common data types that would be used to represent information in that gaming app:

## null

The *null* data type has only one value: `null`. null is the value of a variable that explicitly has no value. Thus, it represents a *lack of value*. However...

```jsx
console.log(typeof null)
< "object"  // Fail! Remember, JS was written in 10 days by one dude!
```

Because of this behavior, the use of null is somewhat controversial in the JavaScript community.

## undefined

A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type `undefined`. For example:

```jsx
let cohort // cohort currently holds undefined
console.log(cohort)
```

In addition, a function by default returns `undefined` if a value was not explicitly returned using the `return` keyword.

Lastly, you will see `undefined` if you enter code directly into the browser‚Äôs console and it evaluates a statement that does not return a value.

```jsx
console.log(typeof undefined)
console.log('hello')
```

## symbol

The *symbol* data type was added with ES2015 and is primarily used to create unique and less visible properties on objects.

Their use is rare in general JavaScript programming.

# Object Data Type

The six data types we've looked at thus far are classified as ***primitive*/*value*** data types because they hold only a **single value**.

Most programming languages also have **complex/reference** data types designed to hold more complex data structures.

JavaScript only has one **reference** type - the **object**.

Objects are collections of zero or more key:value pairs known as properties.

We will learn more about *objects* in a later lesson.

For now, let's just verify what `typeof` returns:

```jsx
// We'll try an object
let myObject = {course: 'SEI', cohort: 4} // Object
console.log(typeof myObject)

// An array
let myArray = [] 
console.log(typeof myArray)

// And a Regular Expression
let myRegEx = /./ 
console.log(typeof myRegEx)
```

Although *functions* are also considered objects (*callable objects* to be exact), the `typeof` operator returns a more helpful data type:

```jsx
let myFunction = function(){}
console.log(typeof myFunction)
```

# Review Questions ‚ùì

1. Do all variables have a data type?
2. Is `let _save = ''` a valid statement?
3. If a variable is not a string, number, boolean, null, undefined, or a symbol, it must be an __________.

## Type Conversion

JavaScript is very relaxed when it comes to data types. Contrary to non-dynamic languages, a variable can change its type.

```jsx
let m = 15 // I'm a number
m = 'hey' // Now I'm a string!
```

## Beware of Implicit Conversion

JavaScript is friendly and tries to help us whenever it can. However, we all know that sometimes it's better to be left alone.

**Try adding a string to a number. What did JS do?**

**Now try comparing a number and a string containing the same digits using the equality (`==`) comparison operator**

```jsx
13 == "13" // returns true!
```

This is why, unless there's a reason not to do so, we use the *strict equality operator* (`===`) as it will not perform type conversion.

## Explicit Type Conversion

We can easily convert a number to a string using the `toString()` and `toFixed()` methods:

```jsx
let n = 123.456
let s1 = n.toString() // "123.456"
let s2 = n.toFixed(2) // "123.46"
```

There are a couple of handy methods used to convert strings to numbers: `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()`

```jsx
let s = "1234.567"
let n1 = parseInt(s) // 1234
let n2 = parseFloat(s) // 1234.456
```

Remember, however, that the data type for both flavors, integer, and float (short for floating-point), is *number*.
